## Achievements
The goal of this project was to learn C++ while also creating a game. All the main features were achieved, although to varying degrees. Some features were implemented a better than others, so there is room for future optimisation. However, this was a successful project as i managed to learn everything i wanted and more. The visual and interactive essence of the project adds so much more to the game than just the code ever could. The outcome was a good first effort at learning C++ while also making a game that is fun and visually appealing.
